    "### Network Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Network science is an interdisciplinary field that studies complex networks, which are systems of interconnected elements. These networks can be found in various domains, from biological systems to social interactions, technological infrastructures, and more. The primary goal of network science is to understand the structure, dynamics, function, and evolution of networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Networks**: Unlike regular networks (like a lattice or a ring), complex networks have non-trivial topological features, such as a scale-free degree distribution, high clustering, and small-world properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes and Edges**: In the language of network science, individual entities are referred to as \"nodes\" (or vertices), and the connections between them are called \"edges\" (or links).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metrics and Measures**: Network science employs various metrics to understand networks, such as:\n",
    "   - **Degree**: The number of connections a node has.\n",
    "   - **Path Length**: The shortest distance between two nodes.\n",
    "   - **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures the degree to which nodes cluster together.\n",
    "   - **Centrality**: Identifies the most important nodes in a network.\n",
    "   - **Modularity**: Measures the strength of division of a network into modules or communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Types of Networks**:\n",
    "   - **Scale-Free Networks**: Networks where some nodes have many more connections than others, following a power-law distribution.\n",
    "   - **Small-World Networks**: Networks characterized by short path lengths between nodes and high clustering.\n",
    "   - **Random Networks**: Networks where connections between nodes are made randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Applications**: Network science has applications in various fields:\n",
    "   - **Biology**: Studying protein-protein interaction networks, neural networks, and ecological networks.\n",
    "   - **Sociology**: Analyzing social networks to understand patterns of human interactions.\n",
    "   - **Technology**: Understanding the internet's structure, power grids, and transportation networks.\n",
    "   - **Economics**: Analyzing trade networks, financial networks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Dynamics and Processes**: Beyond static properties, network science also studies dynamic processes on networks, such as diffusion, spreading, synchronization, and cascading failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Interdisciplinary Nature**: Network science draws on theories and methods from physics, mathematics, biology, social science, computer science, and other disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Tools and Software**: Various software tools, like Gephi, NetworkX, and Cytoscape, have been developed to visualize and analyze networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, network science provides a framework to analyze and understand the intricate web of connections in various systems, revealing insights about their structure, function, and underlying principles.\n"

    "### Visibility Graph Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A visibility graph is a method used to transform time series data into a complex network. The primary objective is to capture the underlying patterns and structures of the time series in the form of a graph, allowing for the application of graph-theoretical methods to analyze the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the visibility graph is to map a time series into a graph where:\n",
    "- Each data point in the time series becomes a node in the graph.\n",
    "- Two nodes (or data points) are connected by an edge if, and only if, they can \"see\" each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion for \"visibility\" between two data points is defined geometrically. If a straight line can be drawn between two data points without intersecting the time series curve at any other point, then those two data points are said to be visible to each other, and hence, an edge is drawn between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Visibility Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly two types of visibility graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Natural Visibility Graph (NVG)**: In this type, two data points \\( $(n, a_n)$ \\) and \\( $(m, a_m)$ \\) are connected if every data point \\( k \\) between \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) satisfies the condition:\n",
    "> $a_k < a_n + (a_m - a_n) \\frac{m-k}{m-n}$\n",
    "and\n",
    "> $a_k < a_m + (a_n - a_m) \\frac{k-n}{m-n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG)**: In this type, two data points \\( $(n, a_n)$ \\) and \\( $(m, a_m)$ \\) are connected if every data point \\( k \\) between \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) satisfies the condition:\n",
    "> $a_k < \\min(a_n, a_m)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility graphs have found applications in various domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physics**: To analyze non-linear time series data from physical systems.\n",
    "- **Finance**: To study stock market data and understand market dynamics.\n",
    "- **Biology**: To analyze sequences and patterns in biological data.\n",
    "- **Climate Science**: To study temperature and other climatic time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Universality**: Visibility algorithms can be applied to any kind of time series data.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: The method is geometrically intuitive and easy to implement.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Allows for the application of graph-theoretical methods to time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility graphs provide a novel way to study time series data by transforming it into a network. This transformation reveals patterns and structures in the data that might not be immediately evident from the time series alone.\n"

    "### Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) is a method used to transform a time series into a network. It's a specific type of visibility graph that focuses on horizontal visibility between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the HVG is similar to the general visibility graph, but with a specific criterion for visibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each data point in the time series becomes a node in the graph.\n",
    "- Two nodes (or data points) are connected by an edge if they can \"see\" each other horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion for \"horizontal visibility\" between two data points is defined as follows: Two data points \\( $(n, a_n)$ \\) and \\( $(m, a_m)$ \\) are connected if every data point \\( k \\) between \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) satisfies the condition:\n",
    "> $a_k < \\min(a_n, a_m)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, if you can draw a horizontal line between two data points without intersecting the time series curve at any other point, then those two data points are said to be horizontally visible to each other, and hence, an edge is drawn between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Horizontal Visibility Graph provides a unique way to study time series data by transforming it into a network. This transformation can help in revealing hidden patterns, periodicities, or structures in the data that might not be immediately evident from the time series alone.\n"

    "### Recurrence Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Recurrence Plot** (RP) is a graphical representation used to visualize recurrent patterns in time series data. It provides a way to visualize the behavior of dynamical systems and identify patterns, periodicities, and structures in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recurrence plot is a two-dimensional square plot of size \\($N \\times N$\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of data points in the time series.\n",
    "- Each point in the plot corresponds to a pair of time points in the time series.\n",
    "- A point \\($(i, j)$\\) is colored (or marked) if the state of the system at time \\(i\\) is close to its state at time \\(j\\), based on a predefined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrence plots are used in various domains, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Physics**: To study the dynamics of physical systems.\n",
    "- **Biology**: To analyze biological signals like EEG or ECG.\n",
    "- **Economics**: To study financial time series.\n",
    "- **Climate Science**: To analyze climatic data and identify patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recurrence Quantification Analysis** (RQA) is a method used to quantify the structures and patterns observed in a recurrence plot. It provides numerical measures that describe the complexity and determinism of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recurrence Rate (RR)**: The proportion of recurrent points in the recurrence plot.\n",
    "2. **Determinism (DET)**: The proportion of recurrent points that form diagonal lines. It indicates the predictability of the system.\n",
    "3. **Laminarity (LAM)**: The proportion of recurrent points that form vertical or horizontal lines. It indicates the presence of laminar states or plateaus.\n",
    "4. **Trapping Time (TT)**: The average length of the vertical or horizontal lines. It indicates the average time the system stays in a state.\n",
    "5. **Divergence (DIV)**: The inverse of the longest diagonal line. It indicates the average time for the system to diverge from a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "RQA is used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantify the complexity of time series data.\n",
    "- Compare different time series or segments of a time series.\n",
    "- Identify transitions or changes in the dynamics of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Recurrence Plot and Recurrence Quantification Analysis provide powerful tools for the analysis of time series data. While the Recurrence Plot offers a visual representation of the recurrent patterns in the data, RQA provides numerical measures that quantify these patterns, offering deeper insights into the dynamics of the system.\n"

    "### Recurrence Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Recurrence Network** is a complex network representation derived from a recurrence plot, which is a graphical tool used to visualize and analyze recurrent patterns in time series data. The concept of recurrence networks bridges the gap between nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basics of Recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrence is a fundamental property of many dynamical systems, where states that have been visited once are visited again. This property can be visualized using a recurrence plot, where a point (i, j) is plotted if the state of the system at time i is close to its state at time j.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructing a Recurrence Network:\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrence network is constructed from a recurrence plot by treating each time point in the time series as a node and connecting two nodes if there's a point in the recurrence plot corresponding to those two time points. In other words, two nodes (or time points) are connected if the states of the system at those times are close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics and Measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrence networks can be characterized using various complex network measures, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.\n",
    "2. **Average Path Length**: Represents the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes.\n",
    "3. **Degree Distribution**: Shows the distribution of the number of connections each node has to other nodes.\n",
    "4. **Transitivity**: Measures the probability that the adjacent vertices of a vertex are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrence networks have been applied in various domains to analyze time series data, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Climate Science**: To study and detect climatic transitions and tipping points.\n",
    "- **Biology**: For analyzing patterns in biological data, such as heart rate or EEG signals.\n",
    "- **Physics**: To study the dynamics of various physical systems.\n",
    "- **Finance**: To analyze stock market data and understand market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Versatility**: Can be applied to any kind of time series data.\n",
    "2. **Insightful**: Provides insights into the dynamics of the system generating the time series.\n",
    "3. **Bridging Disciplines**: Combines techniques from nonlinear dynamics and network theory, allowing for a richer analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrence networks provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of time series data. By transforming time series data into a network, one can gain insights into the recurrent patterns and underlying structures in the data, which might not be immediately evident from traditional time series analysis methods.\n"
